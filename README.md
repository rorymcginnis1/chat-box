# Minature Chat Box

## Description

Engineered an interactive conversational AI chatbox using nlp techniques from scratch. Designed and trained a deep leaning model 

with LSTM architecture for intent classificiation. Trained the model to recoginize and interpret user input, enabling 

the chatbot to understand and respond appropriately.

## Requirements

Must have tensor flow numpy and keras installed

## Run instructions

Simply run the training.py file. It may take a minute or two to train the data but then will allow you to interact with the minature ChatBox. 

More data can be added to the response.json file to increase the variety of responses.

Depending on your machine it may not be able to be ran, if it is not able to be ran [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com) 

can run it. Simply copy the code and paste it in colab and upload the response.json file.
